"""Bite 218. Create a sandwich decorator

After creating our Decorators and Context Managers learning path we 
realized we did not have a beginner decorator Bite, so here it is!

Complete the sandwich decorator which takes a function and 
prints === Upper bread slice === (defined in UPPER_SLICE) 
and === Lower bread slice === (defined in LOWER_SLICE) before 
and after calling the passed in function (func).

And voilÃ  applying this decorator to add_ingredients you have your 
sandwich (see also the tests):

    >>> from sandwich import sandwich
    >>> @sandwich
    ... def add_ingredients(ingredients):
    ...     print(' / '.join(ingredients))
    ...
    >>> ingredients = ['bacon', 'lettuce', 'tomato']
    >>> add_ingredients(ingredients)
    === Upper bread slice ===
    bacon / lettuce / tomato
    === Lower bread slice ===

This is probably the easiest way to demo a decorator. Even so 
decorators can be confusing when you start using them so here is 
an article we wrote some time ago: Learning Python Decorators by Example.
